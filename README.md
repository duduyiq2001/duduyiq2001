### Hi!

My name is **yiqun** and I am a second year computer science student at university of california irvine!
This is my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yiqun-dean-du-4b4583200).  
I am interested in web-development but I am just starting to learn more about it! I hope eventaully I will equip the
skillset of a full-stack developer!
In the past I've tried building a web scraping project using project outside of class. This quarter I am looking to be 
involved in more team projects to gain more experience and skills. My other interest is video game development
I joined video game development club earlier this quarter and I just signed up for some of the pitch projects. So hopefully
I will be let in to a team.
